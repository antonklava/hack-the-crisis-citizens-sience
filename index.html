          <p>
            Itâ€™s the first time the world faces a global pandemic with the
            intensive use of technology. As information spreads in a matter of
            seconds from a local scale of communities to whole countries and
            that the internet is used by the general public but also scientists,
            researchers and governments, the amount of misinformation spreads
            faster than ever.
          </p>

          <p>
            It is also equally important to remember that since this is a global
            pandemic:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Time is NOT on our side</li>
            <li>
              We do NOT have time to wait 10-15 years for evidence to be
              established facts.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>What we <em>DO</em> have on our side is this:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              We have different countries handling the pandemic in different
              ways, results can be vastly different or not depending on
            </li>
            <li>
              We have number of people worldwide asking the same questions
            </li>
            <li>
              Many who have experience of COVID19 within the health sector as an
              example can have required the insight or practice, that in lack of
              evidence, at least could be indications of what might work
            </li>
            <li>
              We as people hear and see news from the all countries. We have a
              right and a moral obligation to come forward with new facts even
              and especially if our authorities will not talk about them.
            </li>
            <li>
              Since time is not on our side, we must rely on what is best
              practice
            </li>
            <li>
              We have a collective strength in all of us from different
              countries when we use our experiences and indicative results.
